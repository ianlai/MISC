Situation: 
In a network with a forward proxy assigned (firewall also maybe), say NET-A, 
we cannot connect to a NAS which is located in another network, say NET-B, in the Internet. 
- The NAS's connect to the Internet through a router which is controllable, so the port forwarding rule is set. 
- If using a device in NET-B, we can access the NAS with it's LAN-IP. 
- If using a device neither in NET-B nor in NET-A, we can access the NAS with the WAN-IP (because port forwarding is set, quickconnect is not needed).
- If using a device in NET-A, we cannot access the NAS. 
- The symptoms of "cannot access" are as the follows.    
  * Manager login page is shown correctly. 
  * After inputing the correct acnt/pwd, it shows loading now but it just hangs. 
  * When it hangs, if we use Chrome development tool to check the traffic, we can see many request of entry.cgi fails with error code 503. 
  * It has the same problem even if we set the manager application's router port to be 80. 
  * The error message of the entry.cgi is captured from Chrome and attached below.
